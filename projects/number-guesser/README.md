# 🎯 Number Guesser (Python)

A simple and fun **Number Guessing Game** built in Python!  
The program randomly selects a number, and the player tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

## 🚀 Features

- Generates a random number within a specified range  
- Gives feedback after each guess (“Too high” / “Too low”)  
- Tracks the number of attempts  
- Option to play again after each round  
- Clean, beginner-friendly Python code  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The computer picks a random number between a chosen range (e.g., 1–100).  
2. The player inputs guesses.  
3. The program tells the player if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.  
4. The game ends when the player guesses correctly or runs out of attempts.
