# Prompt Review & Optimization Recommendations

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. **Conflicting Instructions** (Critical)
- Line 151/170/178: "paraphrase the JD and try not to use the exact language"
- Line 183: "Use the EXACT terminology from the JD when possible"
- Line 193: "Use the SAME terminology and vocabulary from the JD"

**Problem**: These instructions conflict, causing confusion about when to use exact vs. paraphrased language.

### 2. **Insufficient Emphasis on Authenticity**
- Current prompts focus heavily on matching JD but don't emphasize enough that the resume should sound authentic
- Missing guidance on maintaining the candidate's voice and style
- No explicit instruction to avoid obvious copying patterns

### 3. **Keyword vs. Language Balance**
- Need clearer distinction: Technical terms/keywords = exact, but sentence structure = paraphrased
- Should emphasize using resume's original phrasing style

### 4. **Missing Human Reviewer Perspective**
- No instruction to write as if a human reviewer won't notice obvious copying
- Should emphasize natural flow and variation

## Recommended Improvements

1. **Clarify Keyword vs. Language Strategy**
   - Use exact technical terms, tools, platforms, metrics (for ATS)
   - Paraphrase everything else (sentences, structure, phrasing)
   - Maintain resume's original voice and style

2. **Add Authenticity Section**
   - Emphasize natural, authentic writing
   - Use candidate's own phrasing patterns
   - Avoid obvious copy-paste patterns

3. **Enhance Paraphrasing Instructions**
   - Provide examples of good vs. bad paraphrasing
   - Emphasize sentence structure variation
   - Use different action verbs and phrasing

4. **Better Balance Instructions**
   - Technical keywords: EXACT (for ATS)
   - Responsibilities/descriptions: PARAPHRASED (for authenticity)
   - Outcomes/metrics: PRESERVED from resume
